### To do list ( & open questions)

- add notebooks directly to the github account while dev? in its own folder

metrics
-------
- can we easily plot the mean weighted distance and the node count could be plotted as a umap. 
- can we make some kind histogram/distribution plot for teh weighted distance ? 
- can we check if the silhouette score has to be on the PCA space all the time or can it work on the knn o

                      copy=False, something ? (general question )
- make the functions that are part the class directly available (then they return values)

- adjust the plotting functions based on how we save the metrics. 
- Anna fix your weird graoh UMAP ! 
- add annotations to each functions. 
- clean the metrics_stuff (maybe put it in tools as util or a subdirectory) it's up to atai

package
-------
- requirements ? 
- unit test ? (I vote against it because I am lazy)
- let's setup the automated checks on github like Kris did for episcanpy @Anna
- refine umap_barcodes (got critical errors from pycharm)
